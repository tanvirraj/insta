Next is too much. I avoid it like the plague
ha ha, i just find someone like me. now a days i really hate next even unfollow some vercel-influencer lol
only thing i really liked about next was file based routing, but i never used their static generation function, becase most of the app i worked on CSR.

but it's too much to use next only for file-based routing.
on the other other hand remix is much better inmyopinion but that is also havily optimized for SSR.

may be it's good for blog/e-commerce/marketing/content-heavy side.
